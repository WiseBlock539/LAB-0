  <h2>About Me</h2>

  <p class="myP" > I am currently a senior at the Ohio State University pursuing a Information Systems Degree. I am a first generation student from Bangladesh and I have lived in Ohio for 16 years. Something to know about me is that I am someone that works towards a change whether it be something direct like helping an organization or something indirect like helping fund a good cause by donating. I am someone that really enjoys working with teammates and trying to get along with everybody because I believe that work can be done much more efficiently with more hands and minds.   </p>
